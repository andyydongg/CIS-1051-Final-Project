In this project, most of my time was spent coding the website, so mainly HTML and CSS were used. For a lot of the time, I was stuck and confused. After reading through online sources and watching informative videos on coding web pages, I was able to begin coding my homepage. 

The original goal of this project was to create a calendar of some sort and allow people to make reminders on this website. And when the time came around, the website would send the user an email, text, or call them. But, I found that this would take too long to do. 

With my preexisting knowledge, I found that this project has now turned into a clock and some animations using Javascript on p5js. 

I can agree that testing my code after each section was typed proved to be something satisfying as I could see the website coming together one step at a time. I had used used Javascript in the past and used to find it very challenging and time-consuming. But now, I noticed that Javascript has become a little easier after taking this programming class. 

I noticed even if the coding languages are different, the concepts and the way that it runs are sort of similar. This helped me a lot throughout this project, as I was able to grasp new things and understand at faster past. 

When I was coding the animation, I started off with hard coding every point that made up the picture. After a couple of days, I noticed that it could be easily done by using a for i in range statements similar to what we had learned in class for Python. 

There are pictures that are linked and uploaded, these pictures were originally supposed to be used for the website. But later was replaced by Javascript code. 

The project is incomplete as I have added a lot of buttons, links, and pages. I was able to code a small portion of those.
