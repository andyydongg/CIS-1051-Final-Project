In this project, most of my time was spent coding the website, so mainly HTML and CSS was used. For a lot of the time, I was stuck and confused. After reading through online sources and watching informative videos on coding webpages, I was able to begin coding my homepage. 

The original goal of this project was to create a calendar of some sort and allow people to make remindars on this website. And when time came around, the website would send the user a email, text or call them. But, I found that this would take too long to do. 

With my preexisting knowledge, I found that this project has now turned into a clock and some animations using Javascipt on p5js. 

I can agree that testing my code after each section typed proved to be something sastifiying as I could see the website coming together one step at a time. I had used used Javascript in the past and used to find it very challenging and time consuming. But now, I noticed that Javasscript has been become a little easier after taking this programing class. 

I noticed even if the coding languages are different, the concepts and the way that it runs are sort of similar. This helped me a lot through out this project, as I was able to grasp new things and understand at faster past. 

When I was coding the animation, I started off with hard coding every point that made up the picture. After a couple days, I noticed that it could be easily done by using a for i in range statements siamiar to what we had learned in class for python. 

The project is incompplete as I have added a lot of buttons, links and pages. I was able to code a small portion of those.
